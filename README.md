# Mafia-Hacked-Client
Minecraft 1.9 Hacked Client using a proxy

To install:
Install nodejs. http://nodejs.org
Download node-minecraft-protocol and install it
(If on windows download a git shell)
Run getNMP.bat or getNMP.sh
Edit config.json, adding server IP, username and password. This is required because of how minecraft auth works, without the proxy logging you in, you can't connect to online-mode servers. If you're paranoid about password stealing, just read the code.
Double click start.bat (Or if you're on linux I assume you know how to run 'node start.js')
